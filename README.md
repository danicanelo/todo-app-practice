# TodoAppPractice

Simple and functional app for managing daily tasks. Each task is editable and deletable. When a task is marked as completed, it gets automatically strikethrough and moves below active tasks on reload. Tasks can be reordered manually, and the order is persisted in the database (simulated with json server). Once completed, a task can only be deleted, not edited. A feature to add longer notes to each task is currently in development.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.
