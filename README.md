# TodoAppPractice

Simple and functional app for managing daily tasks.

- Each task is editable and deletable.
- When a task is marked as completed, it gets automatically strikethrough and moves below active tasks.
- Tasks can be reordered manually, and the order is persisted in the database (simulated with json server).
- Once completed, a task can only be deleted, not edited.
- ✨ New! When a task is completed, a toast notification appears with a personalized comment generated by AI (needs to install Ollama with the llama3 model, please note that this is a trial feature, and the message will likely take several seconds —depending on your machine— to generate).

Future features:

- A feature to add longer notes to each task.
